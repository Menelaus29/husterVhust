# husterVhust 

**husterVhust** is a tower defense and strategy game heavily inspired by *Plants vs. Zombies*. In this game, players use students from the Hanoi University of Science and Technology as defenders to protect the iconic Ta Quang Buu Library. The attackers represent academic subjects, including Calculus 1, Calculus 2, General Physics 2, Statistics and Probability, and Linear Algebra, which are humorously portrayed as zombies. The game combines strategic gameplay with a playful twist on academic life, making it a fun experience for students and fans of the tower defense genre.
